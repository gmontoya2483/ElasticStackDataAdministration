# Welcome to heartbeat 6.0.0-rc1

Ping remote services for availability and log results to Elasticsearch or send to Logstash.

## Getting Started

To get started with heartbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on your localhost first. After that, start heartbeat with:

     ./heartbeat -c heartbeat.yml -e

This will start the beat and send the data to your Elasticsearch instance. To load the dashboards for heartbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./heartbeat setup -e
