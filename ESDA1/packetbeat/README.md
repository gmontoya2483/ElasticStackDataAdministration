# Welcome to packetbeat 6.0.0-rc1

Packetbeat analyzes network traffic and sends the data to Elasticsearch.

## Getting Started

To get started with packetbeat, you need to set up Elasticsearch on your localhost first. After that, start packetbeat with:

     ./packetbeat -c packetbeat.yml -e

This will start the beat and send the data to your Elasticsearch instance. To load the dashboards for packetbeat into Kibana, run:

    ./packetbeat setup -e
